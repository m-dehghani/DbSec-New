# DbSec-New
Sql server encryption and security
This project has been written in c# and is a windows application.
I use this project when i have to install software on client Db and don't want to view or edit ant data in it.
It uses certificate to encrypt Data and hide data.
also it can dissallow any one to enter the db manager(even admin).
I found a same software on a site with a high price so i decided to create it myslef.
Its free to use for any one for any legitimate uses.
Email me for any help or suggestion.
